To anyone who ever tried to visualize abstract ideas and feelings such as losing oneself in something, obsession, creation, music, beauty, or repetition - I feel you. It's difficult. Very difficult.

I should start by stating that I have nothing against the original cover or poster design for this album. I'm rather fond of it, simplistic as it is, a window peaking into a specific period of time and place in Nils Frahm's tour. It's there, right in front of you, but you can't quite reach it. All you have is music.

I cannot say, nor estimate how many times have I listened through that album, or even more specifically, how many times have I listened to track nr.6 _All Melody._ It went on repeat in my head, when when it wasn't playing.

Often as it is when one is obsessed with something, they claim it for their own, build on it, weave it into themselves. I have this album ingrained in my cliched soul. So naturally, I made my own cover.

How do I materialize losing oneself in something, obsession, creation, music, beauty, and repetition? By a never ending Mobius strip made of musical notation, floating in an undefined and boundless space, of course.
