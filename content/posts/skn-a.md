SKN A is a personalized skin care brand that focuses on transparency and simplicity. Each product and packaging are numbered and color-coded to make life easier.

My objective was to design something streamlined and invoke a sense of cleanliness. It was challenging to make the layout as minimalistic as possible, and at the same time, include all the necessary information.

I opted for black and white as the primary colors, sans serif fonts, simple icons, and a straightforward logo. To simultaneously keep it joyful, I chose a bright pastel color to distinguish each product.![](/content/images/logo.png)
