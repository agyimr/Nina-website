title: Golden joinery

---
Kintsugi is a Japanese art of mending broken pottery with a mixture of lacquer and powdered gold, silver, or platinum. It is less about the environmental consciousness of reusing broken objects, and more about embracing flaws and appreciating imperfections. The golden joinery creates something whole once more, emphasizing the breaks and cracks and presenting them in a new way: valuable, historical, enriching.

This project is a gentle reminder made out of posted notes that just as things are not lesser for being broken, people are not lesser for their weaknesses and faults.

The challenge of this project was to combine a sense of negation to the external ”truth” with the recognition of inner strength. The torn posted note exclaims in confidence ”you can’t tear me”.
