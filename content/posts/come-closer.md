This project focuses on the essence of an artist and their work.

The lack of a signature and minimalistic presentation encourages the viewer to come closer, and by inspecting each piece, discover which author it belongs to.

What from a distance may seem like a block of color, up close, is a connection of grids and multiples, a technique characteristic to both Yayoi Kusama and Agnes Martin. Each brush stroke is made of the artist’s name, transforming the artwork into a signature itself.

The design objective was to create both unique and faithful representations of their paintings, at the same time challenging the viewer. The most difficult task was to ensure the pattern would look good both in miniature and scaled up, which proved troublesome especially in Kusama’s case.
