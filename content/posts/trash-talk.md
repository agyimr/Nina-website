Oftentimes, the gravity of environmental problems gets lost behind graceful slogans, hollow words, and incomprehensible graphs. The issue of global solid waste is hardly an alluring subject, but it is a serious problem nonetheless. The Trash Talk font doesnâ€™t hide anything, it puts it plainly into the world.

My intention for this project was to achieve literality. I believe that there is a difference between reading that the annual production of solid waste equals 2.01 billion tonnes written in a beautiful and eye-catching font, and reading the same message in a font made out of trash.

The most challenging part was to ensure every letter was unique and distinguishable on every background color.
