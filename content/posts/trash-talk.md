Oftentimes, the gravity of environmental problems gets lost behind graceful slogans, hollow words, and incomprehensible graphs. The issue of global solid waste is hardly an alluring subject, but it is a serious problem nonetheless. The _Trash Talk_ font doesnâ€™t hide anything, it puts it plainly into the world.

My intention for this project was to achieve literality. The annual production of solid waste equals 2.01 billion tonnes, and so, it only seems fitting that the facts are spewed right back into the faces of the consumers made out of their hypothetical, and my actual, waste.

But not all is grim. This project intends to inspire, educate, and encourage everyone to do their best. Acceptance and willingness to change is the first step for a more conscious environment, and every small act of ecological kindness counts.

The biggest challenge I faced was ensuring that every letter was unique and distinguishable on every background color.
