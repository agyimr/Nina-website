title: A Little Book of Alchemy

---
A Little Book of Alchemy is a project inspired by the cover of ”Advanced Potion Making” designed by the House of Mina Lima for the Harry Potter franchise.

It is a magical and fantastic book that helped me develop my technical graphic design skills and deepened my passion for visual communication.

At the moment, it ranges over ten chapters and a hundred pages, making it my largest, most challenging, and most satisfying project.
