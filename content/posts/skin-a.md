title: Skin A

---
SKIN A is a skincare brand that focuses on transparency and simplicity. Each product and packaging are numbered, color-coded, and distinguished to make oneâ€™s skincare easier.

My objective was to design something unique and bold that would not only stand out on the store shelf among other products, but invoke a sense of - I want to use that! - in the customer. Skincare can bring joy too!

I opted for deep jewel tones and colour contrast as the focal point of the design. To balance this I wanted the layout to be as minimalistic as possible and decided on a sans-serif font both for the logo and the text. The most challenging aspect of the design was including all the necessary information on the box and label, making it clear and not overwhelming.
