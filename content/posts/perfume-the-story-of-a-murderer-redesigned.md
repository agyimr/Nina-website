Have you ever been connected to something so profoundly, you find yourself reading it in multiple languages, watching it repeatedly, or writing a whole thesis about it?

Or let's say...  remaking it's posters?

To say this book and movie had a grasp on my life so far, is an understatement. And as someone who did write an entire thesis about Patrick Suskind's _Perfume_, let me just say it is not only about some guy killing women. 

Interim, I concentrated on naked, dead women and three specific moments, alienating them in time and on paper/ screen, rather than focus on Grenouille, the killer.

Here, the subject of the naked, killed, female body, is the focal point of each poster.

 However, it was important to represent him, which I did through the background colours. I chose yellow to showcase his madness, obsession, and deceit, blue to indicate his isolation referenced by his frock in the movie, and lastly beige which illustrates the sensation (of smell) and symbolizes the skin of the murdered women which the perfume was made out of. Thus, the murderer remains present, looming in the background over the bodies he killed.
