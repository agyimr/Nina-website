title: Jacobs Nova Scotia

---
Jacobs Nova Scotia is a small, family company that values conscious and sustainable fishing upkeeping with old traditions, for those who care for quality over quantity.

In designing this packaging I wanted to tell a story and connect the outside labels with what’s within the can. I divided the label into two parts: a white top for the surface with a black modest logo, and a blue bottom with a pattern resembling a shoal of fish or fishing boats on the sea. The whole composition becoming a nod to what’s below the surface of the water, the commitment and hard work above it, and, upon opening the can, the outcome of the process - the fish.

The challenge of this design was ensuring it does not become too cluttered or incoherent. I opted for black and white drawings of each fish type instead of pictures, to keep with the simple colour scheme, and made sure that the seam line of the can opening will not cut through any text.
